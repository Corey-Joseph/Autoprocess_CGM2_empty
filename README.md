# Autoprocess_CGM2
This project has been set up to create a script to read a list of files and run an operation on that list.

To set up so that pyCGM2 runs ok from a GitHub pull
1) Create project folder
2) Pull from branch, such as here: https://github.com/pyCGM2/pyCGM2, into project folder
3) Set up virtual environment so that script is coming from working folder and interpreter is as well
4) In pyCharm terminal type "python setup.py install" to install the pyCGM2 package
